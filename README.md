# MyVoice - Speech Assistant
**MyVoice** is an mobile app written in Swift with support for iOS and iPadOS (14.0+). The app is written in UIKit, however some screens are rewritten with SwiftUI.

MyVoice is a text-to-speech tool for helping people who are unable to speak or are losing their ability to speak. It's a simple, yet powerful app for users with conditions that are impacting speaking ability like aphasia or ALS.

This repository contains code from various eras of my programming knowledge - not every line of code is perfect.
That's why I refactor it occasionally. 
The biggest flaw is the lack of Dependency Injection and modern architecture.

MyVoice is still a great, fluid, and responsive app with support for the newest Apple technologies.

I'm proud of it ✌️
